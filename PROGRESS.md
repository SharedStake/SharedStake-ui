## Progress Log

- Initialized plan and progress tracking files.
- Detected toolchain: Vue 2 + Vue CLI 4, Tailwind 2 (PostCSS 7), Yarn classic.
- Upgraded axios and core-js; aligned Vue CLI plugins to 4.5.19; added optional chaining Babel plugin.
- Installed deps with ignore-engines due to Node 22 engine constraints in transitive deps.
- Fixed Node 17+ OpenSSL/Terser issue by setting NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider in scripts.
- Build now succeeds; lints pass.
- Next: Document follow-ups and best practices.
- Updated CI:
  - Amplify: pin Node 18, add yarn ignore-engines, export NODE_OPTIONS in build.
  - GitHub Actions workflow: Node 18, yarn install ignore-engines, lint, build, and run e2e.
