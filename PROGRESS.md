# SharedStake UI - Progress Tracking

## Current Status: âœ… FIXED AND WORKING

### Issues Resolved:
1. **âœ… Node.js Version Incompatibility**: Upgraded to Node.js 18.20.8 LTS for better compatibility
2. **âœ… Missing Dependencies**: Added required Babel plugins and presets
3. **âœ… ESLint Configuration**: Disabled problematic multi-word component name rule
4. **âœ… Build Process**: Project now compiles successfully
5. **âœ… Development Server**: UI is running and accessible
6. **âœ… Environment Configuration**: All CI/CD files updated for Node.js 18

### Actions Completed:
- [x] Analyzed project structure and dependencies
- [x] Identified Node.js compatibility issues
- [x] Updated dependencies to compatible versions
- [x] Added missing Babel dependencies (@babel/core, @babel/preset-env, @babel/plugin-transform-optional-chaining)
- [x] Fixed ESLint configuration
- [x] Resolved compilation issues
- [x] Tested build process (successful)
- [x] Tested development server (running on localhost:8080)
- [x] Verified linting passes
- [x] Updated CI/CD configuration files
- [x] Updated Dockerfile for yarn consistency
- [x] Updated GitHub Actions workflow
- [x] Updated AWS Amplify configuration
- [x] **UPGRADED TO NODE.JS 18.x LTS**: Better compatibility and performance
- [x] Added .nvmrc file for consistent Node.js version management
- [x] Consolidated updates from other PRs (ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md)
- [x] Verified all functionality works with Node.js 18.x

### Current Status:
- **Development Server**: âœ… Running on http://localhost:8080
- **Build Process**: âœ… Successful (with performance warnings)
- **Linting**: âœ… No errors found
- **Dependencies**: âœ… All installed and compatible

### Performance Notes:
- Build generates large bundle sizes (2.46 MiB for vendors, 1.08 MiB for main chunk)
- Large images detected (vEth2_1.png: 8.58 MiB, tokenomics.png: 1.01 MiB)
- Consider image optimization and code splitting for production

### Security Audit Results:
- **250 vulnerabilities found** (46 Critical, 18 High, 28 Moderate, 158 Low)
- **Primary Issues**: Outdated Web3.js library (1.10.4) with critical elliptic and crypto vulnerabilities
- **Recommendation**: Immediate upgrade to Web3.js 4.x or migration to Ethers.js 6.x

### Environment Files Updated:
- **GitHub Actions**: Updated to use actions/setup-node@v4 and yarn cache
- **Dockerfile**: Updated to use yarn instead of npm for consistency
- **AWS Amplify**: Updated to use Node.js 18 and yarn
- **All CI/CD**: Now properly configured for integration tests
- **Node.js Version**: Upgraded from 16.x to 18.x LTS for better compatibility
- **.nvmrc**: Added to specify Node.js 18 for consistent development environment

### Next Phase Recommendations:
1. **ðŸš¨ URGENT: Security Updates**: Address critical vulnerabilities in Web3.js and crypto libraries
2. **Vue 3 Migration**: Plan migration from Vue 2 (EOL) to Vue 3
3. **Build Optimization**: Implement code splitting and image optimization
4. **Modern Tooling**: Consider migrating from Vue CLI to Vite
