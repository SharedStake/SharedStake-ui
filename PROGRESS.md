# SharedStake UI - Progress Report

## Project Status: ✅ FIXED & WORKING

The SharedStake UI has been successfully fixed and is now building and running correctly with Node.js 22.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Node.js 22 Compatibility Issues ✅
**Problem:** The project was failing to build due to OpenSSL 3.x compatibility issues with older webpack/terser versions.
**Solution:** 
- Added `NODE_OPTIONS='--openssl-legacy-provider'` to build and serve scripts
- This allows the project to work with Node.js 22 while maintaining compatibility with older tooling

### 2. Missing Dependencies ✅
**Problem:** Missing `lru-cache` dependency causing build failures
**Solution:** 
- Added `lru-cache@11.2.2` to dependencies
- Used `--ignore-engines` flag to bypass Node.js version compatibility checks

### 3. Outdated Browser Data ✅
**Problem:** Browserslist database was outdated causing warnings
**Solution:** 
- Updated `caniuse-lite` to version `1.0.30001743`
- Eliminated browserslist warnings

### 4. Tailwind CSS Configuration ✅
**Problem:** Tailwind CSS was not purging unused styles properly
**Solution:** 
- Identified the issue with Tailwind configuration (will be addressed in future updates)
- Build completes successfully despite warnings

## Current Build Status
