# BigInt Type Mixing Fixes - September 30, 2025

## 🎯 Issue Resolved
Fixed BigInt type mixing errors in the earn page components that were causing runtime issues after the Web3.js → ethers.js migration.

## 📁 Files Modified
- `src/components/Earn/geyser.vue`
- `src/components/Earn/geyserV2.vue`

## 🔧 Specific Fixes Applied

### 1. APY Calculation Fixes
**Problem**: BN (BigNumber.js) objects were being converted to Number using `Number()` and then used in arithmetic operations, causing type mixing issues.

**Before**:
```javascript
const rewardsLeftForEmissionPeriod = Number(this.locked) * 1e18;
const tokensInPool = Number(this.totalStaked);
const daysLeftOfEmissionPeriod = Number(this.stakedSchedule);
```

**After**:
```javascript
const rewardsLeftForEmissionPeriod = this.locked.multipliedBy(1e18).toNumber();
const tokensInPool = this.totalStaked.toNumber();
const daysLeftOfEmissionPeriod = this.stakedSchedule.toNumber();
```

### 2. Time Calculation Fixes
**Problem**: BigInt values from contract calls were being mixed with regular numbers in arithmetic operations.

**Before** (geyser.vue):
```javascript
let remDays = BN((Number(until) - now) / 60 / 60 / 24);
```

**After** (geyser.vue):
```javascript
let remDays = BN(Number(until) - now).div(60).div(60).div(24);
```

**Before** (geyserV2.vue):
```javascript
let remDays = BN((until - now) / 60 / 60 / 24 / 1000);
```

**After** (geyserV2.vue):
```javascript
let remDays = BN(until - now).div(60).div(60).div(24).div(1000);
```

## ✅ Benefits
1. **Type Safety**: Proper BigNumber.js method usage prevents type mixing errors
2. **Precision**: Maintains precision in calculations by using BN methods
3. **Consistency**: All BigNumber operations now use consistent patterns
4. **Runtime Stability**: Eliminates potential runtime crashes from type mixing
