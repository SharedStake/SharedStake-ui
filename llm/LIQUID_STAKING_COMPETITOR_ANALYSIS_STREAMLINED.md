## Missing Features Analysis

### Permissionless vs Centralized Staking Models

#### Rocket Pool (Permissionless) vs Lido (Centralized)

| Aspect | Rocket Pool (Permissionless) | Lido (Centralized) | SharedStake (Current) |
|--------|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Node Operation** | Anyone can run a node (16 ETH + RPL) | 30 selected operators | Professional operators only |
| **Decentralization** | High - 1000+ independent operators | Low - 30 operators control 99% | Medium - Professional operators |
| **Barriers to Entry** | High technical knowledge required | Operator selection only | N/A (not offered) |
| **Slashing Risk** | Distributed across operators | Concentrated in few operators | Professional management |
| **Governance** | Community-driven, permissionless | Centralized operator selection | Centralized management |
| **Fees** | 5-15% (varies by operator) | 10% fixed | 5% fixed |
| **Scalability** | Limited by operator capacity | High - can scale quickly | Medium - depends on capacity |
| **Security Model** | Distributed risk, community oversight | Concentrated risk, operator oversight | Professional oversight |

#### Key Differences:

**Rocket Pool Permissionless Model:**
- **How it works**: Anyone with 16 ETH + RPL collateral can become a node operator
- **Benefits**: True decentralization, no single point of failure, community ownership
- **Challenges**: Higher technical barriers, slower scaling, complex governance
- **Risk**: Distributed across many operators, but each operator has slashing risk

**Lido Centralized Model:**
- **How it works**: 30 carefully selected professional operators run all validators
- **Benefits**: Professional management, fast scaling, lower technical barriers for users
- **Challenges**: Centralization risk, operator dependency, governance complexity
- **Risk**: Concentrated in few operators, but professional management reduces risk
