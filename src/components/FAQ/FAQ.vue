      <h2>How does SharedStake generate fees on the platform?</h2>
      <p>When you initially deposit and stake vETH2, only a 0.315% fee goes to the DAO treasury plus 5% of earnings using the protocol. With a whopping 95% of earnings going directly to the liquidity providers, staking with SharedStake quickly becomes profitable.</p>

      <h2>Can I stake any amount of ETH and earn a positive return?</h2>
      <p>You can stake as little as 0.1 ETH and simply hold onto your vETH2 staking tokens to be eligible to receive ETH 2.0 staking rewards.</p>

      <h2>Are displayed protocol APYs always 100% accurate?</h2>
      <p>Protocol APYs are generated based on the total combined participants in the pool and the period of time all participants were staked. Coming in as a new participant, protocol APYs may slightly vary from those displayed. </p>

      <h2>How does SharedStake compare with Lido Finance, Rocket Pool, and other competitors?</h2>
      <p>SharedStake offers a competitive return compared to the rates offered by other staking services such as Lido and Rocket Pool. By using vETH2 instead of wETH or other wrapped tokens, we are able to give our users an additional 7-8% annually with off-chain profit distribution. Additionally, SharedStake is a community led project, whereas other staking services in the space are VC-lead. Other future benefits will include lending and borrowing, such as using your vETH2 stake as collateral.</p>

      <h2>What is the long-term vision of SharedStake?</h2>
      <p>Our vision is to be the best ETH 2.0 staking solution in DeFi by offering better rewards, user experience and DeFi Compatibility than any other Staking-as-a-Service model on the market.</p>

      <h2>Has SharedStake been audited before and if so, what were the results?</h2>
      <p>We were audited by Certik. No major issues found and any minor concerns have since been addressed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.certik.org/projects/sharedstake">Read to report here.</a></p>

      <h2>Explain the relationship between SharedStake and the Ethereum Foundation. Who is generating my return?</h2>
      <p>SharedStake is partnered with the Ethereum Foundation to provide ETH 2.0 staking. Returns come directly from the Ethereum Foundation. By using vETH2 instead of wETH or other wrapped tokens, we are able to give our users an additional 7-8% annually with off-chain profit distribution.</p>

      <h2>Can I redeem my staked ETH at any time?</h2>
      <p>SharedStake keeps 10% of all ETH deposits in a side pool to allow for people to exit their stake at any time. However, the nature of ETH 2.0 staking is that all ETH staked is locked until the ETH 2.0 merge. If the side pool runs out, you will not be able to swap your vETH2 back for ETH until the merge.</p>
      <p>However, we have set up vETH2 liquidity through <a href="https://saddle.finance/">Saddle Finance</a> to provide alternative exit options for users who wish to do so.</p>
      
      <h2>Where can I buy SGT?</h2>
      <p>You can buy SGT on Uniswap via <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x84810bcf08744d5862b8181f12d17bfd57d3b078&use=V2">this link</a>.</p>
      <p>Contract address for SGT is: 0x84810bcf08744d5862b8181f12d17bfd57d3b078. View more stats on <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x84810bcf08744d5862b8181f12d17bfd57d3b078">Etherscan</a></p>

      <h2>Why are there only 10m SGT tokens and how long till they are all in circulation?</h2>
      <p>SGT tokenomics are the result of countless hours of internal and external participation in the SharedStake protocol. The emissions rate of our pools is determined by the DAO, which the community is incentivized to participate in.</p>
      
      <h2>Is SGT considered to be an “altcoin”?</h2>
      <p>Yes. SGT is a governance token on the Ethereum blockchain used to improve the SharedStake protocol. “Altcoin'' is merely a blanket term, applied to anything that isn’t Bitcoin. Ultimately, viewing SGT as a governance token is more accurate.</p>

      <h2>What are the benefits of staking SGT?</h2>
      <p>Staking SGT rewards you with additional SGT tokens, an added benefit to holding SGT other than governance, and price exposure to SharedStake as a project. </p>

      <h2>How can I be sure my investments will be safe from hackers?</h2>
      <p>You can never have 100% protection from hackers. All DeFi protocols are exposed to some degree of smart contract risk, including hacks and exploits.

      <h2>What is vETH2?</h2>
      <p>vETH2 is SharedStake’s token which represents ETH staked in the ETH 2.0 staking contract. After the merge, vETH2 will be redeemable for ETH at a 1:1 rate. You can check out all blocks generated by SharedStake's ETH2 validators on <a href="https://beaconcha.in/blocks?q=sharedstake.org">the beacon chain</a>.</p>

      <h2>What role does Saddle Finance play in SharedStake?</h2>
