## 🎯 What is Ethereum Staking?

Ethereum staking is the process of locking up ETH to help secure the Ethereum network and earn rewards in return. Since Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) in September 2022, staking has become the primary way to earn passive income on your ETH holdings.

When you stake ETH, you're essentially becoming a validator that helps process transactions and maintain network security. In return, you earn staking rewards that typically range from 4-8% APR, depending on network conditions.

<br/>

### 🔄 How Ethereum Staking Works

<br/>

| Component | Description | Your Role |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Validator Node** | Computer running Ethereum software | You or a staking service runs this |
| **Staked ETH** | 32 ETH minimum locked in contract | Your capital contribution |
| **Attestations** | Voting on block validity | Validator automatically does this |
| **Block Proposals** | Creating new blocks | Validator does this when selected |
| **Rewards** | ETH earned for participation | Your passive income |

<br/>

> **💡 Key Point:** Staking rewards come from two sources: **block rewards** (new ETH created) and **transaction fees** (MEV and tips).

<br/>
<br/>

## 📊 Ethereum Staking Rewards: What to Expect

<br/>

### 💰 Current Reward Rates (2024)
