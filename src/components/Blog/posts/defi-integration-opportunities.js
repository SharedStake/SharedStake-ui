    <h2>DeFi Integration Opportunities</h2>
    <p>One of the key advantages of liquid staking is the ability to use your staked assets across the broader DeFi ecosystem. With vETH2 tokens, you can participate in various DeFi protocols while still earning staking rewards.</p>
    
    <h3>Popular Integration Strategies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lending:</strong> Use vETH2 as collateral in lending protocols</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity Pools:</strong> Provide liquidity for additional yield</li>
      <li><strong>Yield Farming:</strong> Stake vETH2 in yield farming strategies</li>
      <li><strong>Cross-Chain:</strong> Bridge vETH2 to other networks</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Risk Management</h3>
    <p>While DeFi integration offers additional opportunities, it's important to understand the risks involved. Always do your own research and never risk more than you can afford to lose.</p>
    
    <p>We're working on partnerships with leading DeFi protocols to make integration seamless and secure for our users.</p>
