    <h3>Audit Results</h3>
    <p>The audit covered all critical components of our protocol, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Staking contract security</li>
      <li>Reward distribution mechanisms</li>
      <li>Validator management systems</li>
      <li>Emergency pause functionality</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <p>CertiK identified several areas for improvement, all of which have been addressed in our V2 launch. The audit confirmed that our core protocol is secure and ready for production use.</p>
    
    <p>We're committed to maintaining the highest security standards and will continue regular audits as we develop new features.</p>
