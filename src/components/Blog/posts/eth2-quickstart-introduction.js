    <h2>Why Run Your Own Ethereum Node?</h2>
    <p>In the world of blockchain and decentralized finance, running your own Ethereum node represents the ultimate form of sovereignty and participation in the network. Whether you're a solo staker, a pool operator, or simply someone who values censorship resistance and direct blockchain access, operating your own node puts you in control.</p>
    
    <p>However, the complexity of setting up and maintaining an Ethereum node has traditionally been a significant barrier to entry. Between choosing the right clients, configuring security settings, managing updates, and ensuring optimal performance, the process can be overwhelming even for experienced developers.</p>

    <h2>What Makes eth2-quickstart Different?</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Battle-Tested Configurations</h3>
    <p>The scripts incorporate real-world lessons from running nodes in production. Every configuration option has been carefully chosen based on community experience and best practices.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Security First</h3>
    <p>From the moment you run the first script, security is prioritized:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automatic creation of non-root users</li>
      <li>SSH hardening with key-only authentication</li>
      <li>Firewall rules that protect critical services</li>
      <li>Fail2ban to prevent brute-force attacks</li>
      <li>JWT authentication between execution and consensus clients</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Flexibility Without Complexity</h3>
    <p>While the tool provides sensible defaults that work for most users, everything is configurable through a single <code>exports.sh</code> file. Need different ports? Different cache sizes? Different MEV relays? Just update the configuration file.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Active Maintenance</h3>
    <p>The Ethereum ecosystem evolves rapidly. eth2-quickstart is actively maintained to incorporate new features, support new clients, and adapt to network upgrades.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Complete Documentation</h3>
    <p>Every script is documented, every configuration option explained. The repository includes comprehensive guides for different scenarios, troubleshooting tips, and architectural explanations.</p>
    
    <h2>System Requirements</h2>
