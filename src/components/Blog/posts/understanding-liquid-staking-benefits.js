    <h2>What is Liquid Staking?</h2>
    <p>Liquid staking is a revolutionary approach to Ethereum 2.0 staking that allows users to stake their ETH while maintaining liquidity. Unlike traditional staking, liquid staking provides users with tradeable tokens representing their staked position.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Access to your staked funds without waiting for the unlock period</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Trade, lend, or use staked assets in DeFi protocols</li>
      <li><strong>Compound Returns:</strong> Reinvest rewards automatically for better yields</li>
      <li><strong>Lower Barriers:</strong> Stake any amount, not just 32 ETH minimums</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How SharedStake Works</h3>
    <p>When you stake ETH with SharedStake, you receive vETH2 tokens that represent your staked position. These tokens can be used across the DeFi ecosystem while your underlying ETH continues to earn staking rewards.</p>
    
    <p>Our protocol automatically manages validator operations, ensuring optimal performance and security for all participants.</p>
