|------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Humans** | Set priorities, define success metrics, establish coding standards | Strategic direction, business context, quality gates |
| **AI** | Analyze codebase patterns, identify optimization opportunities | Pattern recognition, systematic analysis, implementation strategies |

> **💡 Key Insight:** AI excelled at finding patterns across 49+ files, while humans provided the strategic context and business priorities.

### 🔧 Guided Refactoring Process

| Step | AI Contribution | Human Contribution | Result |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Analysis** | Identified 200+ refactoring opportunities | Prioritized by business impact | Focused improvement plan |

**Example Refactoring Flow:**
```javascript
// AI identified this pattern across multiple files:
const balance = await contract.methods.balanceOf(address).call();

// Proposed modern ethers.js equivalent:
const balance = await contract.balanceOf(address);

// Human validated and added error handling:
try {
  const balance = await contract.balanceOf(address);
  return Number(balance);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Balance fetch failed:', error);
  return 0;
}
```

### 🐛 Bug Squashing Collaboration

**Security Implementation:**
```javascript
// Before: Hardcoded API key (SECURITY RISK)
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  'https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY'
);

// After: Environment variable with fallback
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  process.env.VUE_APP_RPC_URL || 'https://ethereum.publicnode.com'
);
```
