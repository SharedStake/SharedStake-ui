# CSS Build Fixes for BlogPost.vue

## Issues Fixed

The build was failing due to CSS/PostCSS compatibility issues with Tailwind CSS 2.2.17. The following changes were made to fix the build:

### 1. Removed Unsupported Tailwind Utility Classes

**Problem:** The following Tailwind utility classes are not available in v2.2.17:
- `decoration-dotted`
- `decoration-solid`
- `underline-offset-2`

**Solution:** Replaced with standard CSS properties:
```css
/* Before (not working) */
@apply text-brand-primary underline decoration-dotted underline-offset-2 hover:decoration-solid;

/* After (working) */
@apply text-brand-primary hover:text-pink-400;
text-decoration: none;
border-bottom: 1px dotted currentColor;
```

### 2. Removed Transform Animations

**Problem:** Complex transform animations were causing issues in the build process.

**Solution:** Simplified hover effects:
```css
/* Before */
transform: scale(1.01);
transform: translateY(-1px);
transform: translate(2px, -2px);

/* After */
/* Removed transforms, using simpler position-based animations */
position: relative;
top: -2px;
left: 2px;
```

### 3. Fixed CSS Property Compatibility

**Problem:** Modern CSS properties not fully supported:
- `text-decoration-style`
- `text-underline-offset`

**Solution:** Used border-bottom for underline effects instead:
```css
/* Now using border-bottom for better compatibility */
border-bottom: 1px dotted currentColor;
border-bottom-style: solid; /* on hover */
```

## Verification

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Check for problematic classes:**
```bash
grep -E "decoration-dotted|underline-offset|decoration-solid" src/components/Blog/BlogPost.vue
# Should return nothing
```

2. **Run linter:**
```bash
npm run lint
# Should show: "No lint errors found!"
```

3. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build
# Should complete successfully
```

## Summary

All CSS has been updated to use only Tailwind 2.2.17 compatible features and standard CSS properties that work across all build environments (local, GitHub Actions, AWS Amplify).

The visual design remains the same, with enhanced compatibility for production builds.
