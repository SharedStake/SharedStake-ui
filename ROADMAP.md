# SharedStake UI - Development Roadmap

## Current Status: Working but Needs Modernization

While the application is now building and running successfully, there are several areas that need attention for long-term maintainability and performance.

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Node.js Version Management ðŸ”´
**Current Issue:** Using temporary workaround with `--openssl-legacy-provider`  
**Recommended Action:** 
- Upgrade to Vue CLI 5.x or migrate to Vite
- Update webpack to version 5.x which has native Node.js 22 support
- Remove dependency on OpenSSL legacy provider

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Impact:** High - Removes technical debt and improves build performance

### 2. Vue.js Framework Upgrade ðŸŸ¡
**Current State:** Vue 2.6.11 (End of Life)  
**Recommended Action:**
- Migrate to Vue 3.x
- Update Vue Router to v4
- Update Vuex to v4 or migrate to Pinia
- Update all Vue ecosystem packages

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks  
**Impact:** High - Security updates, performance improvements, future-proofing

### 3. Build Tool Modernization ðŸŸ¡
**Current State:** Vue CLI 4.x with webpack 4.x  
**Recommended Options:**
- **Option A:** Upgrade to Vue CLI 5.x
- **Option B:** Migrate to Vite (recommended for better performance)

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Impact:** Medium-High - Faster builds, better development experience

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 4. Dependency Security Updates ðŸŸ¡
**Current Issues:**
- Several packages have security vulnerabilities
- Outdated peer dependencies causing warnings

**Recommended Actions:**
```bash
# Update these packages:
axios: ^0.21.1 â†’ ^1.7.2 (security fix)
sweetalert2: ^10.16.7 â†’ ^11.12.4
three: ^0.126.1 â†’ ^0.167.1
core-js: ^3.6.5 â†’ ^3.37.1
```

**Timeline:** 1 week  
**Impact:** High - Security improvements

### 5. Tailwind CSS Update ðŸŸ¡
**Current State:** PostCSS 7 compatibility mode  
**Recommended Action:**
- Upgrade to Tailwind CSS 3.x
- Update PostCSS to version 8.x
- Fix purge configuration

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Impact:** Medium - Smaller bundle sizes, modern features

### 6. ESLint Configuration Update ðŸŸ¡
**Current Issues:**
- Using deprecated `babel-eslint` parser
- ESLint version warnings

**Recommended Actions:**
- Update to `@babel/eslint-parser`
- Update ESLint rules for Vue 3 compatibility
- Add TypeScript support if needed

**Timeline:** 3-5 days  
**Impact:** Medium - Better code quality, modern tooling

## Low Priority Tasks

### 7. Bundle Size Optimization ðŸŸ¢
**Current Issues:**
- Large vendor bundle (3.14 MiB)
- CSS bundle could be optimized (3.59 MiB)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement code splitting
- Optimize image assets
- Enable tree shaking
- Consider lazy loading for routes

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Impact:** Medium - Better user experience

### 8. Development Experience Improvements ðŸŸ¢
**Recommended Actions:**
- Add TypeScript support
- Implement hot module replacement
- Add development tools and debugging utilities
- Improve error handling and logging

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks  
**Impact:** Medium - Better developer productivity

### 9. Testing Infrastructure ðŸŸ¢
**Current State:** No visible test setup  
**Recommended Actions:**
- Add unit testing with Vitest or Jest
- Add component testing with Vue Test Utils
- Add E2E testing with Playwright or Cypress
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks  
**Impact:** High - Code quality and reliability

## Web3 Specific Considerations

### 10. Web3 Library Updates ðŸŸ¡
**Current State:** 
- `web3: ^1.5.3` (outdated)
- `ethers: ^6.12.1` (current)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Update Web3.js to latest version or migrate fully to ethers.js
- Update Web3-Onboard packages to latest versions
- Review wallet connection logic for compatibility

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Impact:** Medium-High - Better wallet compatibility

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (1-2 weeks)
1. Fix Node.js compatibility permanently
2. Update security-critical dependencies
3. Fix Tailwind CSS configuration

### Phase 2: Framework Modernization (4-6 weeks)
1. Migrate to Vue 3
2. Update build tooling (Vue CLI 5 or Vite)
3. Update all ecosystem packages

### Phase 3: Optimization & Testing (4-6 weeks)
1. Bundle size optimization
2. Implement testing infrastructure
3. Performance improvements

### Phase 4: Long-term Improvements (ongoing)
1. TypeScript migration
2. Advanced optimizations
3. Monitoring and analytics

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Vue 2 is End of Life (security vulnerabilities)
- OpenSSL legacy provider is a temporary workaround

**Medium Risk:**
- Large bundle sizes affecting performance
- Outdated dependencies with potential security issues

**Low Risk:**
- Development experience improvements
- Advanced optimizations

## Resource Requirements

**Development Time:** 12-16 weeks total  
**Team Size:** 1-2 developers  
**Skills Required:**
- Vue.js 2 â†’ 3 migration experience
- Modern JavaScript build tools
- Web3/Ethereum development knowledge
