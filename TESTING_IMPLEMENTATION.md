### What Was Implemented

1. **Unit Testing Framework** ✅
   - Vitest + Vue Test Utils setup
   - Component testing for critical UI components
   - Mock utilities for Web3, Vuex, and Router
   - Test coverage reporting (70% threshold)

2. **End-to-End Testing** ✅
   - Playwright configuration for cross-browser testing
   - Critical user journey tests (staking, earning, withdrawal)
   - Mobile responsiveness testing
   - Accessibility testing

3. **CI/CD Integration** ✅
   - GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing
   - AWS Amplify integration for build-time testing
   - Security auditing and vulnerability scanning
   - Test coverage reporting to Codecov

4. **Test Coverage** ✅
   - Unit tests for core components (SharedButton, ConnectButton, Blog, Navigation)
   - E2E tests for main user flows
   - Accessibility and responsive design testing
   - Error handling and edge case testing

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Testing Stack
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest + Vue Test Utils + jsdom
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **Coverage**: V8 provider with HTML/JSON reports
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + AWS Amplify
- **Security**: Snyk + yarn audit

## 🚀 Usage

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run unit tests
yarn test                    # Watch mode
yarn test:run               # Single run
yarn test:coverage          # With coverage

# Run E2E tests
yarn test:install           # Install browsers
yarn test:e2e              # Run E2E tests
yarn test:e2e:ui           # With UI

# Run all tests
yarn test:all              # Unit + E2E
```

### CI/CD Integration

Tests run automatically on:
- **Push to main/develop**: Full test suite
- **Pull Requests**: Unit tests + E2E tests
- **Security**: Weekly vulnerability scans
- **Build**: Pre-build testing in Amplify

## 📊 Test Coverage

### Unit Tests
- **Components**: SharedButton, ConnectButton, Blog, Navigation
- **Coverage Target**: 70% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Mocking**: Web3 providers, Vuex store, Vue Router
- **Utilities**: Reusable test helpers and factories

### E2E Tests
- **User Journeys**: Landing → Staking → Earning → Withdrawal
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Mobile**: iPhone 12, Pixel 5 viewports
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Console error monitoring

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Core Configuration
- `vitest.config.js` - Vitest configuration
- `playwright.config.js` - Playwright configuration
- `jest.config.js` - Jest compatibility (for tools)
- `tests/setup.js` - Global test setup

### CI/CD Configuration
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Main test workflow
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Security scanning
- `amplify.yml` - AWS Amplify integration

## 🛡️ Security & Quality

### Security Measures
- **Dependency Auditing**: yarn audit on every build
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Snyk integration
- **High Severity Blocking**: Build fails on high-severity issues
- **Weekly Scans**: Automated security monitoring

### Quality Gates
- **Linting**: ESLint on every commit
- **Type Safety**: BigInt handling and type checking
- **Performance**: Bundle size monitoring
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance testing

## 📈 Monitoring & Reporting
