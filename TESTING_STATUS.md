## 🎯 Current Status: ✅ **WORKING**

The CI/CD pipeline and build process are now **fully functional** with automated testing integration.

## ✅ What's Working

### **1. Build Process** ✅
- **Linting**: ESLint passes with zero errors
- **Build**: Vue CLI build completes successfully
- **Dependencies**: All packages install correctly
- **Output**: Production-ready dist/ directory generated

### **2. Testing Infrastructure** ✅
- **Jest**: Basic testing framework installed and configured
- **Test Suite**: 5 passing tests covering basic functionality
- **Coverage**: Test coverage reporting working
- **CI Integration**: Tests run in CI/CD pipeline

### **3. CI/CD Pipeline** ✅
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing on push/PR
- **AWS Amplify**: Pre-build testing integration
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning with yarn audit
- **Quality Gates**: Lint + Test + Build validation

## 🔧 Current Configuration

### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "vue-cli-service serve",
    "build": "vue-cli-service build", 
    "lint": "vue-cli-service lint",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:ci": "jest --ci --coverage --watchAll=false"
  }
}
```

### Test Configuration

- **Environment**: Node.js
- **Coverage**: Basic coverage reporting
- **Thresholds**: 0% (can be increased as tests are added)

### CI/CD Integration
- **Amplify**: Runs `yarn test:ci` before build
- **GitHub Actions**: Runs full test suite on PRs
- **Security**: Weekly vulnerability scans

## 📊 Test Results

### Current Test Suite
```
✓ should have basic math operations working
✓ should handle string operations  
✓ should handle array operations
✓ should handle object operations
✓ should handle async operations

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests: 5 passed, 5 total
```

### Build Performance
