# Agent Instructions

<!-- kimi-delegate:begin -->
## Kimi Delegate Routing — MANDATORY

All Kimi subagent calls MUST route through the skill wrapper. Direct `pi --provider kimi-coding` calls are **prohibited** — they bypass telemetry, fallback, auth detection, and timeout scaling.

- **One-liner:** `kimi-delegate --task "..."`
- **Interactive:** `kimi-delegate --interactive`
- **Long path (fallback):** `./skills/kimi-delegate/scripts/delegate.py --task "..."`

**Why this matters:**
- Structured envelopes prevent vague handoffs
- Auto-scaling timeouts prevent hangs on large repos
- Auth error detection gives explicit resume steps instead of silent failures
- Codex fallback ensures tasks always complete
- Telemetry enables continuous improvement

**Bypassing the wrapper will be detected and reported.**

- Always produce an envelope first with `./skills/kimi-delegate/scripts/plan_prompt.py --task "..."`.
- Keep delegation scoped and include acceptance criteria.
- If Kimi fails, keep fallback enabled and inspect telemetry (`./skills/kimi-delegate/scripts/kimi_delegate_telemetry.py summary --days 14`).

<!-- devin-delegate:begin -->
## Devin Delegate Routing — MANDATORY

All Devin calls MUST route through the skill wrapper. Direct `devin --print` and `devin --task` calls are **prohibited** — they bypass envelope checks, fallback routing, clarification handling, and telemetry.

- **One-liner:** `devin-delegate --task "..."`
- **Interactive:** `devin-delegate --interactive`
- **Long path (fallback):** `./skills/devin-delegate/scripts/delegate.py --task "..."`

**Why this matters:**
- Structured envelopes prevent vague handoffs
- Codex then Claude guidance resolves many clarification loops before human escalation
- Provider fallback keeps execution moving when Devin fails
- Telemetry enables continuous improvement

**Bypassing the wrapper will be detected and reported.**

- Always produce an envelope first with `./skills/devin-delegate/scripts/plan_prompt.py --task "..."`.
- Keep delegation scoped and include acceptance criteria.
- If Devin asks for clarification, use Codex guidance first and Claude second before asking a human.
- Inspect telemetry regularly (`./skills/devin-delegate/scripts/devin_delegate_telemetry.py summary --days 14`).
