PLACEHOLDER: This file needs to be replaced with an actual 1200x630px image.

Design Requirements:
- Background: Dark theme (#1a1a1a or similar)
- Logo: SharedStake logo (white version)
- Text: "SharedStake"
- Subtext: "Ethereum Liquid Staking Platform"
- Value Prop: "4-8% APR • No 32 ETH Minimum • Full Liquidity"
- Visual: ETH token, staking rewards, DeFi integration icons
- Colors: Dark background, red (#E20050) accents, white text
- File size: < 100KB (optimized JPEG)

Twitter-specific considerations:
- Higher contrast for better visibility
- Larger text than OG image
- Prominent SharedStake logo
- Test with Twitter Card Validator

The actual image should be created and saved as twitter-card.jpg in this location.
